## What to give them:

**Option 1: One-line install (recommended)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tf-gpu-devcontainer/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Option 2: GitHub repository**
- Push this folder to your GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tf-gpu-devcontainer`
- Tell them to clone it or use it as a template

## Next steps:

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tf-gpu-devcontainer.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Tell your friends**: "Run the one-liner above, then `newtf project-name` anywhere!"

3. **They get instant neural networks coding**:
   - No build times (pre-built image)
   - GPU acceleration ready
   - TensorFlow 2.20 working
   - Example notebooks included

## What they'll do:
```bash
# Install newtf
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tf-gpu-devcontainer/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Create neural network project instantly
newtf my-awesome-ai
cd my-awesome-ai

# Open in VS Code and reopen in container
code .
# Then: Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
```

**Boom! They're coding neural networks in under 2 minutes!** üöÄ
